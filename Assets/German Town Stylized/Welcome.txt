Thank you for purchasing the Stylized German Town Pack!

You can immediately start with creating your first environment. 
Open the Prefabs folder, take a look at the variety of assets and start constructing your scene.
Multiple demoscenes are included aswell.


If you like the package we would greatly appreciate a small review on the product page! :)
I hope you'll have fun creating interesting and beautiful scenes!



Tips:
Use the Post Processing Stack and switch to Linear Color Space for better visuals (Availabe for free as a Unity Plugin)
